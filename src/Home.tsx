      <h2>Redux Selector Test Bench</h2>
      <p>
        This is a test site to try and determine the behaviour of selectors and curried selectors in javascript memory and performance.
        Each button across the top is a different style of implementing a selector. These are NOT good examples to copy as the point is to understand the behaviour rather than be correct.
